# Continue Your MuleSoft Journey

## Current Progress Summary
You've successfully completed:
1. ✅ Set up Anypoint Studio
2. ✅ Imported and ran your first MuleSoft application
3. ✅ Explored visual flow development
4. ✅ Learned DataWeave basics with live preview
5. ✅ Used the visual debugger to step through flows

## Your Working Application
- **Project**: `~/src/mulesoft-starter`
- **Endpoints**:
  - GET http://localhost:8081/health
  - GET http://localhost:8081/api/employees
  - GET http://localhost:8081/api/employees/{id}

## To Resume Tomorrow

### Quick Start
1. Open Anypoint Studio
2. Your project should be in the workspace
3. Right-click `mulesoft-starter` → Run As → Mule Application
4. Test with: `curl http://localhost:8081/health`

### Suggested Next Steps (Pick One)

#### Option A: Complete CRUD Operations
"Help me add UPDATE and DELETE endpoints to complete the employee API"

#### Option B: Error Handling
"Show me how to implement proper error handling in my MuleSoft flows"

#### Option C: Add a New Integration
"Let's add a new connector - maybe sending emails when employees are created"

#### Option D: Testing with MUnit
"Teach me how to write unit tests for my MuleSoft application"

#### Option E: External API Integration
"Show me how to call an external REST API from my MuleSoft app"

## Helpful Context for Tomorrow
- You're comfortable with the visual flow editor
- You understand DataWeave basics
- You know how to use the debugger
- Hot deployment is working (save = auto-reload)
